## Introduction

Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) appears in several approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG). A main consequence is the modification of particle dispersion relations. Generally, this modification can be parameterized as a series expansion:

$$
\begin{align}
    E_a^2= & m_a^2+p_a^2 \left[1+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \eta_a^{(n)}\left(\frac{p_a}{E_\text{Pl}}\right)^n\right] \\
    E_a^2= & m * m_a^2+p_a^2 \left[1+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \eta_a^{(n)}\left(\frac{p_a}{E_\text{Pl}}\right)^n\right] \\,
    \label{eq:MDR_a}
\end{align}
$$

where $E_a$, $p_a$, and $m_a$ denote the energy, momentum, and mass of particle type $a$, respectively. The correction is suppressed by the scale of new physics, $E_\text{Pl}$---typically identified with the Planck energy ($E_\text{Pl} \approx 1.22 \times 10^{19}$ GeV)---and its strength is characterized by the dimensionless coefficients $\eta_a^{(n)}$.

In phenomenological studies, it is standard to assume that the modification is dominated by a single correction term of order $n$. The integer $n$ defines the order of the suppression, classifying models as energy independent ($n=0$), linear ($n=1$), or quadratic ($n=2$). Furthermore, for ultra-relativistic particles ($p_a \gg m_a$), the dispersion relation can be approximated as:

$$
\begin{equation}
    E_a \simeq p_a \left[ 1 + \frac{m_a^2}{2p_a^2} + \frac{\eta_a^{(n)}}{2} \left(\frac{p_a}{E_\text{Pl}}\right)^n \right] \,.
    \label{eq:energy_a}
\end{equation}
$$

It is worth noting that, even within the validity of the ultra-relativistic limit, the ratios $(m_a/p_a)^2$ and $\eta_a^{(n)}(p_a/E_\text{Pl})^n$ can be of comparable magnitude.

Theoretical consistency is often ensured by embedding these dispersion relations \eqref{eq:energy_a} within the Standard Model Extension (SME), a comprehensive Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework that includes all Lorentz-violating operators. A crucial feature of this framework is the relationship between CPT symmetry and the dimension of the operator responsible for the violation. Typically, terms with even $n$ are associated with CPT-even operators, which affect all chiral states similarly. Conversely, terms with odd $n$ usually stem from CPT-odd operators, which are sensitive to chirality. This distinction leads to differing phenomenological behaviors for chiral fermions.

In this work, we focus specifically on the Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) sector. In the standard theory, the photon and the electron (and positron) are the only stable particles. However, LIV modifications can kinematically permit decay processes in vacuum that are otherwise forbidden, such as photon decay ($\gamma \to e^+ e^-$) or vacuum Cherenkov radiation ($e \to e \gamma$). We will analyze the constraints arising from these induced instability windows. We first consider single-parameter models where only one particle species carries the LIV modification. Subsequently, in Section III, we extend the analysis to the two-parameter scenario, exploring the consistency of bounds when both species are modified simultaneously.
